This project is a cross-platform library (Linux, Windows, Mac) for capturing data from the Intel RealSense F200, SR300, R200, LR200 and the ZR300 cameras. This effort was initiated to better support researchers, creative coders, and app developpers in domains such as robotics, virtual reality, and the internet of things. Several often-requested features of RealSense devices are implemented in this project, including multi-camera capture.
